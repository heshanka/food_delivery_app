# food_delivery_app

A sample Flutter application for a food delivery service; Includes categories, products, a cart system and a favorites system.


Flutter was selected due to the ease of use and familiarity. One of its drawbacks is that it is has relatively not mature debugging tools when compared to Android Studio. There is no specific drawback about the usage of Flutter in the scope of this project. It is usually the case when platform-dependent situations need to be addressed.

This application uses Scoped Model architecture for state management, making the app simpler and more responsive. With this library the updating of widgets were done quite easily.

Currently the app is not connected to an API (data is stored locally) though a connection - an actual API can be done if more time were to be spent on this project; Also more safety checks can be implemented to handle data if so. The app can also contain more features such as a profile section, and related details with more time. The design can also be improved to prove more user-friendliness: e.g. confirmation dialogs, and tested for compatibilities(design) among devices . 

One of the difficulties I encountered (and subsequently solved) was updating and storing of the favorites list and related mechanisms.
